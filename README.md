# Kanji Buddy

**Kanji Buddy** is a small, self-contained web app for kanji review and lookup.  
It runs entirely offline using a local SQLite database and an Express backend.  
You can add, edit, or review cards directly from the browser — no accounts, no sync, just local data.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Tested on Node.js v24**  
  > Note: **Node v25 is not supported** — `better-sqlite3` currently breaks on it.
- **npm** or **pnpm**
- Any modern browser

---

## 🧩 Setup & Usage

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# (optional) import your kanji list
node utils/import-ods.js ./path/to/KanjiList.ods/xlsx/etc

# start the local server
node server.js
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

All data (review sessions, settings, and database) stays local on your machine.

## 🧪 Notes

The project uses:
- **Express** for serving static content  
- **Kysely** + **better-sqlite3** for the local database
